# NLP---Sentiment-Analysis-on-IMDB-Reviews

**SUMMARY:**

Binary Classification model to perform sentiment analysis on movie reviews by TF-IDF vectorization.

**Definition of the problem:**

Film Junky Union, a new cutting-edge community for classic movie enthusiasts, is developing a system to filter and categorize movie reviews. The goal is to train a model capable of automatically detecting negative reviews. To achieve this, a dataset of IMDB movie reviews with polarity labels will be used to build a model that classifies reviews as positive or negative. The model must achieve an F1 score of at least 0.85.

**Technologies Used:**

* Language: Python 3.10
* Environment: Jupyter Notebook
  * Main Libraries:
    * Pandas (data processing)
    * Math / Numpy / Collecgtion (numerical operations)
    * Matplotlib / seaborn (data visualization)
    * Tqdm / nltk / spacy / re (natural language processing)
    * Scikit-learn (modeling, validation and evaluation)

      
**How to Run:**

1. Clone this repository.
2. Open the .ipynb file in Jupyter Notebook or VS Code.
3. Run the cells in order.
